## Memory Leak Examples

#### 1. Memory Leak in Java
  look at the code [MemoryErrorInJava.java](docs/src/main/java/org.example/MemoryErrorInJava.java) is documented with comments to explain the behavior of the JVM when it comes to memory errors.
## Memory Leak Detection Tools
  memory leak detection tools are used to detect memory leaks in Java applications. These tools are used to monitor the memory usage of the application and to detect memory leaks. The following are the most popular memory leak detection tools:
### Verbose Garbage Collection
 verbose garbage collection is a feature of the JVM that allows you to monitor the garbage collection process. This feature is enabled by adding the following JVM argument to the command line:
```   
-verbose:gc
```
for example:
```
java -verbose:gc -jar myapp.jar
```
jcmd is a command-line tool that allows you to send diagnostic commands to a running JVM. The following command can be used to enable verbose garbage collection:
```
jcmd <pid> VM.flags -verbose:gc
```
more information about verbose garbage collection can be found in the following link:
